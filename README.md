# Rewrite of the EUC vACC Discord bot

## Purpose

This rewrite is made to reorganise and sanitise the previous code of the bot. It will also improve its functionalities and provide additional features, according to the discord.py rewrite and its updated library

## Roadmap
[X] Create a local user database manager with essential user data to make the bot work

[X] Create a tickets function

[ ] Create a user sector authorisation command to add/remove sector auth to users directly from discord + update website database accordingly

[X] Create background tasks to update user roles

[X] Create background tasks to update user nicknames

[X] Create !sectors command which gives information about EUC vACC sectors

[ ] Create a vACC phonebook (TBC)

[X] Make vatsim lookup command for online EUC controllers (and maybe also for online callsigns TBC)

(other ideas will be added here as they come. Submit an issue if you wish to see one, or contact me on discord)
